# Custom Python Shell


## 📖 Overview
This project is a custom shell built using Python that provides an interactive command-line environment. The shell is executable from the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) by simply typing:

``` cmd
shell
```
It can process user inputs, execute commands, and serve as a lightweight alternative to traditional shells like Bash or PowerShell.

## 📌Features

✅ Fully executable from CMD using shell command

✅ Supports basic shell operations and commands

✅ Cross-platform compatibility (can be extended for Linux & macOS)

✅ Can be modified and expanded with additional features


## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Add the executable file to System PATH (so it runs from anywhere).

Open CMD and type:

``` cmd
shell
```
### Usage
Once inside the shell, you can execute commands as you would in a standard terminal.

## Future Improvements

🔹 Command history and autocompletion

🔹 Enhanced error handling

🔹 Support for scripting and batch commands
